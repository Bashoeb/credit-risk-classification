**Module_20_Challenge-Credit_Risk_Classification**

This project aims to develop a logistic regression model for credit risk classification. The objective is to predict whether a loan is healthy or high-risk based on various features provided by the lending company.

**Requirements**

Python v3.10.9

The following libraries are required to run the analysis code:

1. numpy (imported as np): A library for numerical computations and array operations.
2. pandas (imported as pd): A library for data manipulation and analysis.
3. pathlib from the Python Standard Library: A module for working with file paths.
4. confusion_matrix from sklearn.metrics: A function to compute the confusion matrix for model evaluation.
5. classification_report from sklearn.metrics: A function to generate a classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model: A class for logistic regression model implementation. Make sure to have these libraries installed in your environment before running    the analysis code.
